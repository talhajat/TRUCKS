# Trucks Service Cleanup Summary

## Overview
The trucks-service has been successfully cleaned up and refactored to support EXACTLY TWO FEATURES:
1. **Truck Creation** - Users fill out the "Add New Truck" form → Save to database
2. **Truck Display** - Show saved truck data in the main trucks table with proper field mapping

## Changes Made

### 1. Schema Cleanup (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
- ✅ **Removed Models:**
  - `Trailer` model (belongs in trailers-service)
  - `Driver` model (belongs in drivers-service)
  - `Load` model (belongs in loads-service)
  - `Location` model (belongs in locations-service)
  
- ✅ **Simplified Truck Model:**
  - Removed complex relationships (currentDriverId, currentLoadId)
  - Removed foreign key to Location (kept assignedYardId as simple string)
  - Kept attachedTrailerId as simple string reference (no relation)
  - Removed "assigned" status (only: available, maintenance, out_of_service)

### 2. Domain Entity Updates (`src/domain/entities/truck.entity.ts`)
- ✅ Removed currentDriverId from TruckProps interface
- ✅ Removed driver assignment methods (assignDriver, unassignDriver)
- ✅ Updated status validation to exclude "assigned" status
- ✅ Removed isAssigned() method
- ✅ Simplified business logic for two core features

### 3. DTO Updates
- ✅ Created new `TruckTableResponseDto` with exact field mapping:
  ```
  ID/UNIT → vehicleId
  MAKE & MODEL → make + model (combined)
  YEAR → year
  VIN → vin
  STATUS → status
  CURRENT DRIVER → Always "N/A" (null in response)
  ATTACHED TRAILER → attachedTrailerId or "None"
  CURRENT LOCATION → currentLocation
  ODOMETER/ENG HRS → odometer + "NA" for engine hours
  ```
- ✅ Updated CreateTruckDto documentation

### 4. Use Case Updates
- ✅ Updated `GetAllTrucksUseCase` to return properly formatted data
- ✅ Verified `CreateTruckUseCase` handles defaultTrailerId → attachedTrailerId

### 5. Controller Updates (`src/presentation/trucks/trucks.controller.ts`)
- ✅ Updated to use TruckTableResponseDto
- ✅ Kept only 2 endpoints: GET /trucks, POST /trucks (+ health check)

### 6. Repository Updates (`src/infrastructure/repositories/prisma-truck.repository.ts`)
- ✅ Removed references to deleted fields (currentDriverId, currentLoadId)
- ✅ Removed assignedYard includes (no longer a relation)
- ✅ Updated findByDriverId to always return empty array
- ✅ Fixed mapToDomainEntity to handle simplified schema

### 7. Database Migration
- ✅ Applied migration "cleanup_schema" to update database structure
- ✅ Removed unused tables and relationships
- ✅ Updated enums to remove "assigned" status

## Field Mapping Implementation

### Form → Database → Table Display
```
Form Field          → Database Field      → Table Column
vehicleId           → vehicleId           → ID/UNIT
make + model        → make, model         → MAKE & MODEL
year                → year                → YEAR
vin                 → vin                 → VIN
initialStatus       → status              → STATUS
N/A                 → N/A                 → CURRENT DRIVER (always "N/A")
defaultTrailerId    → attachedTrailerId   → ATTACHED TRAILER
assignedYard        → assignedYardId      → CURRENT LOCATION
initialOdometer     → odometer            → ODOMETER/ENG HRS (format: "X mi/NA")
```

## API Endpoints

### 1. GET /api/v1/trucks
- Returns all trucks formatted for table display
- Response uses TruckTableResponseDto
- Current driver always null (displays as "N/A")
- Engine hours always null (displays as "NA")

### 2. POST /api/v1/trucks
- Creates new truck from form data
- Maps defaultTrailerId to attachedTrailerId
- Supports file uploads for documents

## Microservices Compliance
- ✅ **Independence**: trucks-service only handles truck data
- ✅ **Clean boundaries**: No overlap with other services
- ✅ **Future-ready**: Designed for webhook integration with trailers-service
- ✅ **Focused scope**: Exactly 2 features implemented

## Next Steps
1. Test the two core features end-to-end
2. Update frontend to handle the simplified response format
3. Set up webhook endpoints for future trailer-service integration
4. Deploy the cleaned-up service

## Notes
- Driver assignment is now handled by driver-service
- Load assignment is handled by loads-service
- Trailer specifications belong in trailers-service
- Location management belongs in locations-service
